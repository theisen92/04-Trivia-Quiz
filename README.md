## Usage

Trivia question quiz and can be used for learning fun facts and challange yourself to see if you can beat you previous score

I know in the homework it says to do a quiz about coding, but I felt like that is limited to programmers and that trivia questions are more universal
Hopefully that's okay!

## Credits

I primarily used the information from class activities and MDN Developer for resources. Then Also looked up some examples of using object functions on full stack and watched some YouTube videos of similar projects

## Contributing

I worked on the project alone.

## Challenges

The main challenge that I was running into during this project was using an object array to fill in the questions and the local storage.
I was able to figure out the array by doing some digging on full stack and youtube, which I feel is a lot cleaner.
But I wasn't able to figure out the local storage stacking and didn't have time to sit down with a TA but will in the future
So on the score page it just shows the latest score, but I might be able to update it later on.
